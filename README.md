What did you like about this project? >> It was an interesting project. It helped me think of corner scenarios that could arise from a requirement. 
What did you struggle with in this project? When conditions dont work, feel like its the end. I realised I need to do more practice to code a project from scratch.  
What would make your experience with this assessment better? More self practice on small projects.
